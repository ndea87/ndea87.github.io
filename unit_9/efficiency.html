	<h2>Efficiency Evaluator</h2>
	<p>Use the evaluator below to gauge the level of efficiency of each of your employees. The way you use this evaluator is dependent upon the number of employees you have. If you have a smaller number of employees, you can answer the questions in the evaluator for each individual. If you have a high number of employees, you can have the head of each of your departments or the lead on each of your committees to complete the evaluator as pertained to the employees in their respective groups.</p>

	<li>What is the name of the employee? What is his or her position?</li>
	<li>What major tasks were they expected to complete this week? </li>
	<li>What methods did they use to complete their tasks? Did you feel that their methods were effective? Why or why not?</li>
	<li>Did they reach all of their deadlines? If not, why?</li>
	<li>What types of tasks did they have to complete this week? How long do you think each of the tasks should have take?</li>
	<li>Does it take the employee longer to complete certain tasks over others? Why do you think this is?</li>
	<li>What's this employee's error rate after completing tasks? Is the error rate unusually high or do you think it's average?</li>
	<li>Does the employee complete tasks independently or does he or she constantly check in with a supervisor or co-worker while completing a task? Do you think the task should be completed indepedently or collaboratively? Explain.</li>
