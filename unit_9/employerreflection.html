	<h2>Reflection Questionnaire</h2>
	<h3>Ask yourself these questions on a weekly basis to ensure you're monitoring both your professional, personal and emotional growth. Please note that this is the same reflection questionnaire as the one in the "For Employees" section only with a changed perspective. Examine the answers to your questions on a monthly basis and check to see if there are any trends in your answers. Are the trends positive or negative? Explain. </h3>
