	<h2>Organization Survey</h2>
	<h3>Ask yourself these questions on a daily basis to ensure you've completed and organized the tasks you need to do. Record all of your answers in a word document. </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>What essential tasks do you need to get done today?</li>
		<li>What nonessential tasks do you need to get done today?</li>
		<li> List off your essential tasks and take notes of the directions you need to follow to get the tasks done.</li>
		<li>Set deadlines for each of your tasks.</li>
		<li>Do any of your tasks involve the help of another co-worker or co-workers? Mark the tasks that need the help of other co-workers with an "H".</li>
		<li>List off the tasks you've completed as you complete them. Is the task essential or nonessential?</li>
		<li>Have you checked and responded to all of your emails? Check to see if all emails that needed a reply have a "reply" sign. Alternatively, you could send all emails you've replied to into a separate folder.</li>
		<li>Have you checked your phone for voice messages?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>After 4 weeks, email all of your answers to noora.abdulkerim@gmail.com to receive a concise report on your efficiency and progress at work. The report will also include areas that you need to strengthen to become more efficient at work.</p>
